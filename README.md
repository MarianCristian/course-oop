Simple course that helps me walk through important aspects of OOP

## Introduction and purpose
This course tries to introduce the basics of OOP by following a simple online shop example. It’s been designed so that everyone can understand it. After each chapter there is an assignment to strengthen your skills related to things you’ve learnt.

The purpose of this course is not to re-invent the wheel but to help me and maybe you, keep a very simple presentation of what OOP is all about. It tries to present things in an agnostic way in regards to programming languages so that it can be applies no matter of the qualification of the listener

Hope you'll enjoy it!

## What is Object-Oriented Programming
 * An approach to designing and building applications that are easy to understand and change
 * By focusing on objects that interact cleanly with one another
 * Somewhere around a few thousand lines of code, you need organization
 * Adding functions and constant declarations to a global namespace isn't going to scale forever
 * You also find yourself writing repetitive code, if you're not careful

## OOP – Basics
### What is a class?
 * A class can be thought of as a contract, blueprint or a template on how an object should look like
 * Each class should be designed and programmed to accomplish one, and only one, thing(The **S** from the **SOLID** principles)

### What is an object?
 * Objects are the building blocks on Object-Oriented Programming
 * Every object is built from a class
 * An object is an instance of a class
 * Objects have two characteristics:
   * Attributes
      * The data stored within an object represents the state of the object. In OO programming terminology, this data is called ***attributes*** or ***state***
   * Actions
      * The ***action*** of an object represents what exactly that object can do. These actions are also called ***methods*** or ***behaviours***

## OOP – Identifying classes from requirements
 * Every project starts with some words or a user story, in short, with a description
 * Our job is to identify the objects we will use in our application from that description
 * We can start with the nouns and extract the classes from them
