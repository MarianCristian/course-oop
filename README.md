Simple course that helps me walk through important aspects of OOP

## Introduction and purpose
This course tries to introduce the basics of OOP by following a simple online shop example. It’s been designed so that everyone can understand it. After each chapter there is an assignment to strengthen your skills related to things you’ve learnt.

The purpose of this course is not to re-invent the wheel but to help me and maybe you keep a very simple presentation of what OOP is all about. It tries to present things in an agnostic way in regards to programming languages so that it can be applies no matter of the qualification of the listener
